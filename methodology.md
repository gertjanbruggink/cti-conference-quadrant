# Methodology for Building the CTI Conference Quadrant

This methodology outlines the steps to create our CTI Conference Quadrant to visually position cyber threat intelligence conferences based on **Generic vs. Niche** focus and **Theoretical to Operational** application. This guide is designed to explain how we effectively map conferences, enabling attendees to choose events that align with their specific goals in CTI.

### Step 1: Define Evaluation Criteria for Each Axis

Establish the characteristics of each axis to ensure consistency in evaluations.

- **X-Axis (Niche to Generic)**:
  - **Niche**: Focuses on specific CTI subfields, technologies, or industry sectors, offering specialized insights.
  - **Generic**: Broadly covers CTI topics, appealing to a wide audience with general knowledge.

- **Y-Axis (Theoretical to Operational Focus)**:
  - **Theoretical**: High-level concepts, research findings, or frameworks; less immediately actionable.
  - **Operational**: Hands-on, actionable methodologies and tools directly applicable in practice.

### Step 2: Identify and Research Conferences

Compile a list of CTI conferences for evaluation. 

For each conference, research the following:

- **Conference Agenda and Tracks**: Review session topics and speaker backgrounds to assess specificity and operational depth.
- **Audience Target**: Determine if the conference is aimed at decision-makers, technical practitioners, or a broader CTI audience.
- **Previous Attendees’ Feedback**: Check user reviews to gauge the theoretical versus operational focus.
- **Content Depth**: Identify whether content is introductory, intermediate, or advanced, as specialized sessions often indicate niche focus.

### Step 3: Develop a Scoring System

Use a scoring system to quantify each conference's placement on the quadrant. We use a scale of 1-5 scale:

Scoring system: 

* X-Axis (Niche to Generic): 1 = Highly Niche 3 = Moderate Specificity 5 = Very Generic

* Y-Axis (Theoretical to Operational): 1 = Highly Theoretical 3 = Balanced 5 = Highly Operational

### Step 4: Plot the Conferences on the Quadrant

Using the scores from Step 3, we map each conference on a two-dimensional grid.

1. **Create the Quadrant**:
   - Label the X-axis from "Niche" (left) to "Generic" (right).
   - Label the Y-axis from "Theoretical" (bottom) to "Operational" (top).

2. **Map the Conferences**:
   - Place each conference on the quadrant according to its X and Y scores. For instance, a conference with a score of 2 on the X-axis and 4 on the Y-axis would be placed towards the lower-middle area, leaning towards "Operational."

### Step 5: Define Quadrant Sections

We label each quadrant to clarify the types of conferences in each section:

- **Top-Left (Niche & Operational)**: Highly specialized conferences offering hands-on, niche insights.
- **Top-Right (Generic & Operational)**: Conferences covering broadly applicable, practical content, ideal for foundational skills.
- **Bottom-Left (Niche & Theoretical)**: Specialized conferences with a focus on research and niche topics.
- **Bottom-Right (Generic & Theoretical)**: Broad, high-level conferences focusing on general trends, suitable for newcomers.

### Step 6: Add Context with Annotations

To enhance the quadrant’s value, we'll add annotations for each conference:

- **Example Sessions**: List notable sessions that exemplify each conference’s focus.
- **Target Audience**: Specify if the primary audience is managers, red teamers, or analysts.
- **Noteworthy Speakers or Topics**: Mention high-profile speakers, unique topics, or specialized workshops.
- **Accessibility/Cost**: Note if the conference is generally accessible or exclusive/high-cost.

### Finalizing and Presenting the Quadrant

Once complete, the CTI Conference Quadrant provides a clear, visual to help attendees choose the right conference. Include this in marketing materials, presentations, or online resources for easy reference, enabling CTI professionals to quickly assess each event’s value based on focus and applicability.
