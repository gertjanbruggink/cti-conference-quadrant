## How do I use the CTI Conference Quadrant?

Use the CTI Conference Quadrant as your starting point to identify the conferences that best align with your goals in cyber threat intelligence.

Remember, focusing on broadly recognized conferences isn't always the optimal choice. There are valuable insights to gain from niche conferences focused on specialized areas. Each conference serves a different purpose, and the best fit for you depends on how closely an event aligns with your specific needs in the CTI field.

## How does the CTI Conference Quadrant work?

The CTI Conference Quadrant provides a visual representation of the positioning of conferences along two axes: Generic vs. Niche Content and Theoretical to Operational Focus. This framework highlights four types of conferences within the CTI market, where diversity and specificity of focus vary:

* Foundational Events deliver broad, general knowledge and are ideal for newcomers or those looking for high-level insights across the field.
* Niche Innovators focus on specialized content and deep insights, offering unique expertise within specific CTI subfields
* Practical Broad Conferences deliver widely applicable, actionable content, catering to hands-on practitioners across multiple CTI areas.
* Focused Application Conferences provide highly specialized, operational insights for targeted use cases, perfect for deep technical dives in specific CTI domains.
